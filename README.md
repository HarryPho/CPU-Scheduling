# CPU-Scheduling

A program to simulate the execution of processes by a computer system with a large memory, one terminal window per user, a quad-core CPU, and one disk drive. Each process will be described by its class (REAL-TIME or INTERACTIVE) and its start time followed by a sequence of resource requests. 
These resources requests will include CPU requests (RUN), disk reads (DISK) and terminal accesses (TTY). In addition, all real-time processes will have a DEADLINE, by which they must complete.
